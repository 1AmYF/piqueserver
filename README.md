# spades-server [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/piqueserver/piqueserver?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/piqueserver/piqueserver)

## FAQ
> **What's the purpose?**
>
> The purpose of this repo is to be a continuation of PySnip.

<br>

> **What if PySnip development returns?**
>
> Then they would merge our changes and development would be continued
> there, I guess. The important thing is to keep AoS servers alive.

<br>

> **How long will it take for the first release?**
>
> March 2016 probably. 

<br>

> **Why should I use spades-server instead of PySnip/PySpades?**
> 
> * bug fixes
> * improvements
> * better anti-hacking
> * new scripts

<br>

> **What about 0.76 support**
>
> Working with multiple versions is a pain. 0.76 will be suported in the
> future only.

<br>

> **Is that everything?**
>
> Please see also the [original README](OLD_README.md) from PySnip and
> the [Wiki](https://github.com/feikname/spades-server/wiki) for more information.
