# spades-server
A Ace of Spades 0.75/0.76 server based on [PySnip](https://github.com/NateShoffner/PySnip).

## how long will it take for the first release?
March 2016 probably. 

## why I see no code?
I am still deciding wheter to import the last pySnip release or its latest commits.

## why should I use spades-server instead of PySnip/PySpades?
 * bug fixes
 * better anti-hacking
 * new scripts
